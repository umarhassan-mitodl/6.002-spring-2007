description: A mixed-signal printed circuit board containing both analog and digital
  components. The board is one component of a 1000-node acoustic beamformer being
  developed at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The
  board contains a pair of microphones, several resistors, capacitors, and digital
  integrated circuit chips. (Image courtesy of Ken Steele and Anant Agarwal.)
